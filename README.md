# srechallenge
This is a golang program that takes a desired config as a yaml file and a current configuration as a json file, and returns a list of actions need for bringing the current config in-line with the desired configuration.

## Requirements
- The [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) programming language.  
- This repo locally. Run `git clone https://github.com/ashvarts/sre-challenge.git`


## Usage
```
Usage of ./srechallenge:
  -current-config string
        the path to the current config (json api result)
  -desired-config string
        the path to the desired config (yaml configuration)
```

## How to Run
A `config.yaml` and `input.json` files are provided and represent the desired and current configurations.
1. To run the application, clone this repository.
2. Run `go run srechallenge -current-config input.json -desired-config config.yaml`.  

OR
1. Compile a binary for your system by running `go build`, this will create a binary called `srechallenge` in your local directory.
2. Run `./srechallenge -current-config input.json -desired-config config.yaml`.   

## Testing
Tests are included in main_test.go. To run the test clone this repo, and run: `go test -v`.

## Question
> Providing that the external API may be unreliable and the alert configurations can be changed by sneaky SREs manually, how would you design such an application to ensure thereâ€™s no accumulated drift between the real alerts and the desired alerts configuration?

A simple solution would involve running this applicaiton periodically, either in a loop with a sensible sleep setting or with a cron job. However, this could result in a delay between a change in configuration and application. A more sophisticated solution could also add a trigger/webhook that would fire when a new configuration is submitted and would trigger the application for immediate reconciliation. 

## Todo 
- [ ] Refactor tests
    - add more test cases to cover missing scenarios.
    - refactor code into smaller functions.
    - test "Summary".
- [ ] Refactor "Reconcile" and "Main" into smaller pieces. 
    - Add logic to delete everything and return if desired config is empty.
- [ ] Add/improve validation for inputs.
